# SGLXarray
Simple tools for loading [SpikeGLX](https://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/) data, including useful metadata, as [xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/) objects.  
In use at the [Center for Sleep and Consciousness (CSC-UW)](https://centerforsleepandconsciousness.psychiatry.wisc.edu/research-overview/#SLEEP-target-element).  
Tested with Neuropixel 1.0 probes only.

## Additional information
See [example usage](example.ipynb), and refer to function docstrings for more info.
I do have functions for loading digital channels recorded with Multifunction I/O cards, let me know if you need me to integrate them urgently.
